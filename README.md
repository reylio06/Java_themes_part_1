# Java_themes_part_1

1. Implement an example based on inheritance OOP principle (possible examples: shapes, persons, vehicles)

               - also include method overriding

 

2. Implement the following example based on inheritance OOP principle:

               Define an abstract class called Shape with:

                              - attribute: color

                              - abstract methods: calculateArea() and toString()

                              - constructor that sets the color

               Define two classes Circle and Rectangle that extend the Shape class. Implement the abstract methods and add suitable/needed attributes.

               Define a Main class where you create a Circle and a Rectangle and print their details.

              

3. Replace the abstract class from 2. with an interface. Do the necessary adjustments in Circle and Rectangle.

              

4. Implement a class Calculator that overloads a method  called multiply(). Define a Main class to call the different methods and write their output

 

5. Implement an example in java for 3 OOP design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Adapter....)

 

6. Add a csv file in your java project in the resource folder that contains a list of strings.

Provide a console menu with the following options: 

- get number of strings

- get all strings

- get the string with max length

- get the string with min length

- get the strings that are anagrams (contain the same letters dog - god)

- get the strings with at least 3 vowels

- get all strings and replace all vowels with their uppercase counterpart

 

Use java 8 streams for list processing.
